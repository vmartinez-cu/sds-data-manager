# SDS-data-manager

This project is the core of a Science Data System.  

Our goal with the project is that users will only need to modify the file config.json to define the data products stored on the SDC, and the rest should be mission agnostic.  

## Architecture

The code in this repository takes the form of an AWS CDK project. It provides the architecture for:

1. An HTTPS API to upload files to an S3 bucket (*in development*)
2. An S3 bucket to contain uploaded files
3. An HTTPS API to query and download files from the S3 bucket (*in development*)
4. A lambda function that inserts file metadata into an opensearch instance
5. A Cognito User Pool that keeps track of who can access the restricted APIs.  

## Development

The development environment uses a GitHub codespace, to ensure that we're all using the proper libraries as we develop and deploy.  

Everyone gets 50 free hours per month of github Codespace time.  Alternatively, your organization can pay for it to run longer than this.  

To start a new development environment, click the button for "Code" in the upper right corner of the repository, and click "Codespaces".  

If you are running locally, you will need to install [cdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). 

### Poetry set up
If you're running locally, you can install the Python requirements with Poetry:

```
poetry install
```

This will install the dependencies from `poetry.lock`, ensuring that consistent versions are used. Poetry also provides a virtual environment, which you will have to activate.

```
poetry shell
```

If running in codespaces, this should already be done.


### AWS Setup

The first thing you'll need to do is configure your aws environment with:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter in your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key, which can be obtained by setting up a user account in the AWS console. For region, set it to the AWS region you'd like to set up your SDS. For IMAP, we're using "us-west-2"

If you have multiple AWS access/secret key pairs locally, you can add the configuration to `~/.aws/config`. 

```
[imap]
region=us-west-2
aws_access_key_id=<Access Key>
aws_secret_access_key=<Secret Key>
```

Then, you can set the profile used by cdk by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to the profile name (in this case, imap):

```
export AWS_PROFILE=imap
```

You may also need to set the `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` environment variable. 

**NOTE**-- If this is a brand new AWS account, then you'll need to bootstrap your account to allow CDK deployment with the command: 

```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

If you get errors with this command, running with `-v` will provide more information. 

### Deploy

Inside the app.py file, there are two important configuration items which you can alter:

1) SDS_ID - This is just a string of 8 random letters that are appended to each resource.  Alternatively, you can change this to something more meaningful (i.e. "bryan-testing").  Just be aware that this ID needs to be completely unique in each account.  

To deploy the SDS, first you'll need to synthesize the CDK code with the command:

```bash
cdk synth --context SDSID={insert a unique ID here}
```

and then you can deploy the architecture with the following command:

```bash
cdk deploy --context SDSID={insert a unique ID here}
```

for example:

```bash
cdk synth --context SDSID=username-testing
cdk deploy --context SDSID=username-testing
```

After about 20 minutes or so, you should have a brand new SDS set up in AWS.  
This is the repository for the cloud infrastructure on the IMAP mission.

1. Install nodejs newer than version 14.
    <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>

2. Install the aws-cdk:

    ```bash
    npm install -g aws-cdk
    ```

3. Install the package

    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    # optionally install pre-commit hooks
    pre-commit install
    ```

4. Configure your environment with AWS credentials and bootstrap the cdk

    ```bash
    aws configure
    cdk bootstrap
    ```

### Virtual Desktop for Development

Codespaces actually comes with a fully functional virtual desktop.  To open, click on the "ports" tab and then "open in new browser". The default password is "vscode".

### Testing the APIs

Inside of the "scripts" folder is a python script you can use to call the APIs.  It is completely independent of the rest of the project, so you should be able to pull this single file out and run it anywhere.  It only depends on basic python libraries.

Unfortunately right now you need to "hard code" in the lambda API URL and the Cognito App Client at the top of the file after every build.  I'm hoping in the future to determine a better way to automate this.
